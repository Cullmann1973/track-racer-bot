    {
      "question": "How long does shipping take?",
      "answer": "Domestic shipping typically 5-10 business days. International 2-4 weeks. Large rigs ship freight and may require appointment delivery."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I return my rig if I don't like it?",
      "answer": "Returns accepted within 30 days of delivery in original packaging. Customer pays return shipping. Restocking fee may apply."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tools do I need for assembly?",
      "answer": "Allen keys (included), adjustable wrench, rubber mallet helpful, power drill optional for faster assembly. Level recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does assembly take?",
      "answer": "TR80: 2-3 hours. TR120: 3-4 hours. TR160: 4-5 hours. TR8 Pro: 5-6 hours. Add 1-2 hours for monitor stands."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my wheelbase fit?",
      "answer": "All major wheelbases are compatible. Fanatec, Moza, Simagic, Thrustmaster, Logitech all have mounting solutions. Check torque rating matches rig capability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the weight limit?",
      "answer": "Most rigs support 120-150kg (265-330lbs) user weight. Check specific model specs for exact rating."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I upgrade my rig later?",
      "answer": "Yes! 40-series aluminum profile is standard. Monitor stands, shifter mounts, and accessories can be added. Wheel/pedal mounting systems are swappable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the TR80 enough for a direct drive wheel?",
      "answer": "TR80 handles up to 8Nm well. For CSL DD at 5-8Nm, it's fine. For DD1 (20Nm) or higher, recommend TR120 or TR160 for rigidity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need the pedal slider kit?",
      "answer": "Not required but recommended if multiple people use the rig or you want easy adjustment. Adds slight height to pedal deck."
    },
    {
      "question": "What seat should I get?",
      "answer": "GT seat for long sessions and comfort. RS6 for tighter bolstering and sportier feel. Both work for most users under 6'2\" (188cm)."
